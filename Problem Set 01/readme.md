# Array Declaration

```
int a[10]; /* "a" is integer data type array and 10 is the maximum number of value/element/items can be stored in "a" array. */
```
# Array Initialization

```
int a[10] = {2,4,6,8,10,12}; /* maximum 10 value/element/items can be stored in the array. 6 elements are currently stored in "a" array so size of the array is 6*/ 
```
